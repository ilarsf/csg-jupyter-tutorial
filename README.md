# A short tutorial on using the Jupyter notebook

## Downloading

Just do the usual: 

```
git clone https://github.com/welchr/csg-jupyter-tutorial.git
```

Both the notebook `.ipynb` and an already-rendered output file `.html`
are there for checking out. 

Note that if you open the `.ipynb` file in github, some of it will
render, but many things will not work quite right. Best to download and
try it yourself.
