    "Now try opening your browser to http://localhost:8888/ - you should see the interface appear, but now it will be connected to the jupyter notebook server running remotely on the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, ssh will disconnect randomly, and it doesn't restore the connection automatically. For that, you can use autossh. First, install autossh: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# For Linux (if you're on your own linux machine, not our servers)\n",
    "sudo apt-get install autossh\n",

    "brew install autossh\n",
    "\n",
    "# For Windows\n",
    "# Use cygwin - the package manager has autossh. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up the tunnel, now using autossh instead: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# 21325 is the monitoring port autossh uses to make sure the connection is still connected. \n",
    "# Again, random number 1024 < x < 65535. \n",
    "autossh -M 21325 -f -i .ssh/id_rsa -N -L 8888:localhost:8888 user@machine.sph.umich.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this method, you also need to create an SSH key (the `-i .ssh/id_rsa` part in the cmd above.) There are many tutorials out there for creating SSH keys (such as [this one](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys)). Note that you might want to create a better name for your key than `id_rsa` - maybe name it after the server you're connecting to, like `snowwhite`. \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, if you want to use your ssh key for PuTTY, or Pageant (ssh agent), you'll need one additional step - use PuTTYgen to convert the key to the .ppk format that PuTTY needs. PuTTY can also setup [SSH tunnels](http://howto.ccs.neu.edu/howto/windows/ssh-port-tunneling-with-putty/), but you're better off getting autossh + cygwin and using the method above, since autossh automatically watches the tunnel and re-connects if the connection terminates for any reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, after all of that, you can open your browser (on your local machine) to [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/), and see your notebook server. Note that now, when you execute **code**, it runs server-side, not locally on your local machine! Really cool. "
