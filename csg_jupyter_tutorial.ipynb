    "\n",
    "### Using miniconda/anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably the easiest method of all, on all platforms. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the relevant installer for Windows, OSX, and Linux here: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.continuum.io/downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "** WARNING **: the installer will ask if you want to put Anaconda's packages/binaries on your PATH. If you only want to use Anaconda for jupyter related things, but leave your existing R installation as the primary one (when you type R at the terminal), you should say **NO**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# If you added anaconda to your PATH during the install\n",
    "conda install jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you didn't\n",
    "~/anaconda2/bin/conda install jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install optional packages\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Substitute conda for ~/ananaconda2/bin/conda if conda is not on your PATH\n",
    "conda install numpy pandas rpy2 matplotlib seaborn bokeh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install R kernel \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use R code in your notebooks natively (without the %Rpull rpy2 trick), you can install the IRkernel, which allows you to create notebooks for R. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c r r-irkernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, when you start the jupyter notebook server, you should be able to select \"R\" as well as \"Python\" when creating new notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "pip is the python package manager, and it can be used to install python packages locally into your home directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, it can be somewhat of a pain to force pip not to use system installed python packages, even with virtualenvs. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Install pip\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't already have pip (python package installer tool), run this: \n",

    "curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py\n",

    "## How do I run it?\n",
    "\n",
    "### On your own computer\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, there should be an icon on the desktop, or search for jupyter by hitting Win+S. \n",
    "\n",
    "On OSX or Linux, you can type the following in a terminal: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook &\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What's happening when I do this? \n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"margin-right: auto\"><img src=\"jupyter_diagram_local.png\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### On a remote server (like snowwhite, dumbo, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SSH port forwarding\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is more difficult, but nicer if you find that you will want to reconnect to the notebook server often. To do this, you can setup an SSH tunnel to the remote server. The setup ends up looking like the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"margin-right: auto\"><img src=\"jupyter_diagram_remote.png\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a quick tunnel just to test that you can get things working, run this on your local machine (desktop, laptop, etc.): \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Pick a random port number for the tunnel.  \n",
    "# Let's say 8888 for this example as the tunnel port. This is what you'll use in your browser. \n",
    "# The port should be a random number > 1024 and < 65535. \n",
    "ssh -N -L 8888:localhost:8888 user@machine.sph.umich.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Leave that command running on your local computer (or background it by putting `&` at the end.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you've started the jupyter notebook server on machine.sph.umich.edu (whichever head node). If you chose `--port 8888`, then use 8888 in the command above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now try opening your browser to http://localhost:8888/ - you should see the interface appear, but now it will be connected to the jupyter notebook server running remotely on the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, ssh will disconnect randomly, and it doesn't restore the connection automatically. For that, you can use autossh. First, install autossh: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# For Linux (if you're on your own linux machine, not our servers)\n",
    "sudo apt-get install autossh\n",
    "\n",
    "# For OSX\n",
    "brew install autossh\n",
    "\n",
    "# For Windows\n",
    "# Use cygwin - the package manager has autossh. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting up the tunnel, now using autossh instead: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# 21325 is the monitoring port autossh uses to make sure the connection is still connected. \n",
    "# Again, random number 1024 < x < 65535. \n",
    "autossh -M 21325 -f -i .ssh/id_rsa -N -L 8888:localhost:8888 user@machine.sph.umich.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For this method, you also need to create an SSH key (the `-i .ssh/id_rsa` part in the cmd above.) There are many tutorials out there for creating SSH keys (such as [this one](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys)). Note that you might want to create a better name for your key than `id_rsa` - maybe name it after the server you're connecting to, like `snowwhite`. \n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, if you want to use your ssh key for PuTTY, or Pageant (ssh agent), you'll need one additional step - use PuTTYgen to convert the key to the .ppk format that PuTTY needs. PuTTY can also setup [SSH tunnels](http://howto.ccs.neu.edu/howto/windows/ssh-port-tunneling-with-putty/), but you're better off getting autossh + cygwin and using the method above, since autossh automatically watches the tunnel and re-connects if the connection terminates for any reason. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, after all of that, you can open your browser (on your local machine) to [http://localhost:8888/](http://localhost:8888/), and see your notebook server. Note that now, when you execute **code**, it runs server-side, not locally on your local machine! Really cool. \n",
    "\n",
    "**SECURITY NOTE**\n",
    "\n",
    "When running the notebook on a remote server, you should set a password. Otherwise, someone could potentially connect to your notebook, and have an open python shell with your user privileges. Not good. First, generate a password, like so: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from notebook.auth import passwd\n",
    "passwd()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should end up with a password hash that looks something like a random string, for example: `'sha1:2a12986a580e:f5830338dbdf89412fe1b94e5342c369e8e41819'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now copy the hash  into your `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` file: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "c.NotebookApp.password = u'<copy string from above>'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this file doesn't exist, you can generate it by doing: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "jupyter notebook --generate-config\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Remote kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "I ran across this package for creating remote kernels directly, without having to fuss with SSH tunneling (it actually does it for you, for the most part.) I've only tried it very briefly, so your mileage may vary. It's pretty simple to setup: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --user remote_ikernel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And then add a remote kernel, for example on snowwhite: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "remote_ikernel manage --add \\\n",
    "    --kernel_cmd=\"ipython kernel -f {connection_file}\" \\\n",
    "    --name=\"Python (snowwhite)\" --interface=ssh \\\n",
    "    --host=welchr@snowwhite.sph.umich.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
