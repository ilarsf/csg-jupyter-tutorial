<p><strong> WARNING </strong>: the installer will ask if you want to put Anaconda's packages/binaries on your PATH.

<p>On OSX or Linux, you can type the following in a terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter notebook <span class="p">&amp;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>What's happening when I do this?</p>
<div style="margin-right: auto"><img src="jupyter_diagram_local.png"></div><h3 id="On-a-remote-server-(like-snowwhite,-dumbo,-etc.)">On a remote server (like snowwhite, dumbo, etc.)<a class="anchor-link" href="#On-a-remote-server-(like-snowwhite,-dumbo,-etc.)">&#182;</a></h3><h4 id="Using-X11">Using X11<a class="anchor-link" href="#Using-X11">&#182;</a></h4><p>This is probably the easiest way, but it's also quite sluggish. Still good to know if you don't want to go through the trouble of the next option.</p>
<p>Start an X-server running on your computer (Xwin, Exceed, MobaXterm, etc.).</p>
<p>Then, ssh to the server (snowwhite, dumbo, etc.) and run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter notebook --port &lt;random number&gt; <span class="p">&amp;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Where <code>&lt;random number&gt;</code> is &gt; 1024 and &lt; 65535.</p>
<h4 id="SSH-port-forwarding">SSH port forwarding<a class="anchor-link" href="#SSH-port-forwarding">&#182;</a></h4><p>This method is more difficult, but nicer if you find that you will want to reconnect to the notebook server often. To do this, you can setup an SSH tunnel to the remote server. The setup ends up looking like the following:</p>
<div style="margin-right: auto"><img src="jupyter_diagram_remote.png"></div><p>To create a quick tunnel just to test that you can get things working, run this on your local machine (desktop, laptop, etc.):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Pick a random port number for the tunnel.  </span>
<span class="c1"># Let&#39;s say 8888 for this example as the tunnel port. This is what you&#39;ll use in your browser. </span>
<span class="c1"># The port should be a random number &gt; 1024 and &lt; 65535. </span>
ssh -N -L 8888:localhost:8888 user@machine.sph.umich.edu
</pre></div>
<p>Leave that command running on your local computer (or background it by putting <code>&amp;</code> at the end.)</p>
<p>Make sure you've started the jupyter notebook server on machine.sph.umich.edu (whichever head node). If you chose <code>--port 8888</code>, then use 8888 in the command above.</p>
<p>Now try opening your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a> - you should see the interface appear, but now it will be connected to the jupyter notebook server running remotely on the server.</p>
<p>Sometimes, ssh will disconnect randomly, and it doesn't restore the connection automatically. For that, you can use autossh. First, install autossh:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># For Linux (if you&#39;re on your own linux machine, not our servers)</span>
sudo apt-get install autossh

<span class="c1"># For OSX</span>
brew install autossh

<span class="c1"># For Windows</span>
<span class="c1"># Use cygwin - the package manager has autossh.</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Setting up the tunnel, now using autossh instead:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># 21325 is the monitoring port autossh uses to make sure the connection is still connected. </span>
<span class="c1"># Again, random number 1024 &lt; x &lt; 65535. </span>
autossh -M <span class="m">21325</span> -f -i .ssh/id_rsa -N -L 8888:localhost:8888 user@machine.sph.umich.edu
</pre></div>
<p>For this method, you also need to create an SSH key (the <code>-i .ssh/id_rsa</code> part in the cmd above.) There are many tutorials out there for creating SSH keys (such as <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys">this one</a>). Note that you might want to create a better name for your key than <code>id_rsa</code> - maybe name it after the server you're connecting to, like <code>snowwhite</code>.</p>
<p>On Windows, if you want to use your ssh key for PuTTY, or Pageant (ssh agent), you'll need one additional step - use PuTTYgen to convert the key to the .ppk format that PuTTY needs. PuTTY can also setup <a href="http://howto.ccs.neu.edu/howto/windows/ssh-port-tunneling-with-putty/">SSH tunnels</a>, but you're better off getting autossh + cygwin and using the method above, since autossh automatically watches the tunnel and re-connects if the connection terminates for any reason.</p>
<p>Now, after all of that, you can open your browser (on your local machine) to <a href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a>, and see your notebook server. Note that now, when you execute <strong>code</strong>, it runs server-side, not locally on your local machine! Really cool.</p>
<h4 id="Remote-kernels">Remote kernels<a class="anchor-link" href="#Remote-kernels">&#182;</a></h4><p>I ran across this package for creating remote kernels directly, without having to fuss with SSH tunneling (it actually does it for you, for the most part.) I haven't had a chance to try it, unfortunately. If you do, please let me know how it works for you, or send a pull request with this section updated!</p>

<p>When running the notebook on a remote server, you should set a password. Otherwise, someone could potentially connect to your notebook, and have an open python shell with your user privileges. Not good. First, generate a password, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">notebook.auth</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">passwd</span>
<span class="n">passwd</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You should end up with a password hash that looks something like a random string, for example: <code>'sha1:2a12986a580e:f5830338dbdf89412fe1b94e5342c369e8e41819'</code></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered">

<div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>Now copy the hash  into your <code>~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">NotebookApp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">password</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">u&#39;&lt;copy string from above&gt;&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
<p>If this file doesn't exist, you can generate it by doing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter notebook --generate-config

<p>Another important feature is to type something into a cell for which you need help with, and then end it with a ?. For example:</p>
<p><code>np.linalg.svd?</code></p>

<p>In the notebook, you can have cells written in a markup language called <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a>. It's a relatively simple language and is used for most README files on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>.</p>
<p>To make a markdown cell, select the cell and press "M". You should see the little "In [#]" disappear next to the cell. Alternatively, you can use the "Cell" menu and go to Cell Type $\dashrightarrow$ Markdown.</p>
<p>Markdown cells are mainly used to either document what you're doing in the notebook, or they can be used to show code inline. For example:</p>
<p>Here is my algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Step 1</li>
<li>Step 2</li>
<li>Step 3</li>
</ol>
<p>And the code for this algorithm:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">step1</span><span class="p">():</span>
  <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">step2</span><span class="p">():</span>
  <span class="k">pass</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">step3</span><span class="p">():</span>
  <span class="k">pass</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can do a number of interesting things in markdown cells. For one, you can render math or LaTeX expressions, for example:</p>

<p>Bokeh is another interactive plotting library for python, albeit much younger and not quite as nice as plotly. The advantage is that it works locally, without having to send data to plotly and retrieve it each time you wish to construct a plot.</p>
<p>You can view some <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html">example plots</a> on the <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/">Bokeh website</a>.</p>

<p>R has a port of bokeh called <a href="http://hafen.github.io/rbokeh/">rbokeh</a>.</p>
<p>If you're using R as usual, you can install it with:</p>

<pre><code>install.packages("rbokeh")</code></pre>
<p>Or if you're using conda:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>conda install -c r r-rbokeh
</pre></div>
<p>Then, you need to start the notebook with an R kernel (see <a href="#Install-R-kernel-(optional">Installing R kernel</a>) above.)</p>
<p>To make plots appear in the notebook, Lars provides this nice method:</p>

<p>This is slightly more involved. Apparently jupyter cannot enable this functionality by default due to patent issues.</p>
<p>First, you'll want to grab some custom templates that we've created that remove code cells when you generate the HTML output from your notebook. Jupyter doesn't do this by default (potentially because of a patent/licensing issue.)</p>
<p>The templates are located here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>/net/snowwhite/home/welchr/scratch/jupyter_templates/basic_noin.tpl
/net/snowwhite/home/welchr/scratch/jupyter_templates/full_noin.tpl
</pre></div>
<p>You'll want to copy those somewhere, a good location would be: <code>~/.jupyter/templates/</code>.</p>
<p>Now, edit your <code>~/.jupyter/jupyter_nbconvert_config.py</code> file to have this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">HTMLExporter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">template_path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;.&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;/home/&lt;you&gt;/.jupyter/templates/&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong><em> If you don't have a jupyter_nbconvert_config.py file </em></strong>, then you can create one by doing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter nbconvert --generate-config
</pre></div>
<p>Finally, you can create a nice HTML report from your notebooks by doing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter nbconvert --to html --template full_noin &lt;notebook file&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>You can also write PDF and other formats as well.</p>

<p>You can execute an entire notebook without having to use your browser. This can be useful for long running notebooks, or when you might lose your browser connection.</p>
<p>First, make one small tweak to your notebook config (<code>~/.jupyter/jupyter_nbconvert_config.py</code>) that allows for longer execution times:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ExecutePreprocessor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">timeout</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">9999999</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Use the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter nbconvert --execute --allow-errors --inplace --to notebook --template full_noin &lt;notebook file&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>This will execute your notebook, skipping cells that have errors (<code>--allow-errors</code>). Results and output will be saved back into your notebook (.ipynb) file.</p>
<p>Now that you've run your notebook, and the results are saved, you could convert the output into a report:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>jupyter nbconvert --to html --template full_noin &lt;notebook file&gt;
</pre></div>

<p><strong>The session seems to be locked up. What do I do now?</strong></p>
<p>In the top menus, try Kernel $\dashrightarrow$ Interrupt. If that fails, do Kernel $\dashrightarrow$ Restart.</p>
<p>Failing that, you can always kill the Jupyter notebook process itself, and restart it.</p>
<p><strong>How do I hide input code cells while in the notebook interface?</strong></p>
<p>Drop this code into your <code>~/.jupyter/custom/custom.js</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>code_show = true;
function code_toggle() {
  if (code_show) {
    $("div.input").hide();
    $("div.output_wrapper &gt; div.output:empty").parents("div.cell").hide();
  } else {
    $('div.input').show();
    $("div.output_wrapper &gt; div.output:empty").parents("div.cell").show();
  }

  code_show = !code_show;
}

define(['base/js/namespace','base/js/events'], function(IPython, events) {
  events.on('app_initialized.NotebookApp', function(){
    $("#view_menu").append("&lt;li id=\"toggle_toolbar\" title=\"Show/Hide code cells\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"javascript:code_toggle()\"&gt;Toggle Code Cells&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;");
  });
});</code></pre>
<p>This creates an item under the "View" menu to toggle code cells from being shown.</p>
<p><strong>How do I change the indentation on code?</strong></p>
<p>Add the following line to your custom.js file (see above):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nx">define</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="s1">&#39;base/js/namespace&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">&#39;base/js/events&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">IPython</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">events</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nx">events</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;app_initialized.NotebookApp&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(){</span>
    <span class="c1">// This sets the indentation within code cells</span>
    <span class="nx">IPython</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Cell</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">options_default</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">cm_config</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">indentUnit</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">2</span>
  <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>
<p><strong>Can I make the notebook wider in my browser?</strong></p>
<p>Add the following to your custom CSS file <code>~/.jupyter/custom/custom.css</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nc">.container</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="nb">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">1400px</span><span class="p">;</span>
